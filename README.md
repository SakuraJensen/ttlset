# TTLSet
Easy setting of TTL for linux.


Just a very  quick way of setting your ttl.  if your isp requires you to change your ttl every now and then just run "ttlset [number]". "ttlset help" will give you a generic reminder if you can't remember that ;D  Not really that useful but saves one from typing sysctl net.ipv4.ip_default_ttl=number
